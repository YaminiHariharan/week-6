# Week 6

This week's lab is meant to introduce you to some useful tools for gathering data. We will also cover a few more in-depth Python techniques such as classes and running scripts.

In particular, we'll cover the following topics:

- Accessing an API
- Python Scripts
- Classes
- Multiprocessing

## setup

*(As of January 2026)*

1. [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo#forking-a-repository) this repository.
2. Clone this repository using [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/quickstart) or using [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository#cloning-a-repository).
3. See the [environment.yml](./environment.yml) file. Create this environment locally using `conda env create -f environment.yml` and load it, or use an existing environment that already has these packages installed.
4. This week, you will be saving a **.env** file that will be *ignored* by git. Save the .env file shared with you on Canvas into the repository folder. This is needed to run the lab notebook.
5. Edit your repository, commit as you go, and push your changes to your fork.
